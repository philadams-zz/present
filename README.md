present
=======

Simple, clean presentations.

v1:

- slides are written in Markdown
- the engine is Javascript
- the presentation platform is (usually) the browser
- text-only, and the text takes up all available room

v2:

- there are images (max 1 per slide, set as giant background images)
- you can auto-advance (e.g. for lightening talks)

future:

- decouple styles from presentation logic => themes
- other media? probably not
